      <description>Human Pangenome Reference Consortium is an international effort focused on developing an inclusive collection of human reference genomes that represent human haplotype diversity and the tool ecosystem needed to fully utilize this resource. The consortium welcomes the participation of all additional academic, industry partners and non-profit organizations. The value for these members is a highly interactive research environment that involves many aspects of the Human Pangenome Reference Research.
Data Availability â€“ All data contributed to or generated by the HPRC will be made publicly available for research purposes.</description>

      <description>The Human Pangenome Project aims to improve the human reference genome to represent a collection of common haplotypes in human populations, with a pangenome reference assembly that reflects genomic diversity across the globe. As such HPRC has commited to the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) mission and principles and supports its Framework for Responsible Sharing of Genomic and Health-Related Data and aims to adopt GA4GH deliverables where appropriate. Learn more in the GA4GH startup guide and get started as an active contributor in the GA4GH community.</description>

      <title>Systematic Racism</title>

      <description>We call for an end to the systemic racism that has killed and oppressed people of color for centuries. While the primary focus has been on reforming institutions such as policing, education, and law, we know that systemic racism also affects genomics and medicine. One of the aims of the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) is to help address the racial and ethnic biases in genomic resources, most specifically in the human reference genome.</description>

      <description>HPRC goals are to develop resources for the human pangenome. These resources will include high-quality reference genomes, a pangenome tool ecosystem along with annotation of the pangenome reference. Investigators accessing the HPRC data for their research are encouraged to collaborate with the HPRC consortium whenever possible. Please visit the HPRC web site for additional information.
Specific resource sharing plans are maintained by funded investigators of the HPRC and those plans follow the guidelines found at the following link: https://www.</description>

      <description>The Human Pangenome Reference Consortium asked the scientific community to submit assemblies for the HG002 assembly comparision project.
Background: The Human Reference Pangenome Consortium has organized a collection of HG002 (NA24385) data to guide the development of new assembly and evaluation strategies for our reference production efforts.
We accepted assembly submissions for evaluation until March 16, 2020.
Details below. Please contact Karen Miga (khmiga@soe.ucsc.edu) and Erich Jarvis (ejarvis@rockefeller.edu) for details about submitted assemblies.</description>

      <description>Publication Protocol â€“ V1.0 | April 7, 2020
The goal of the HPRC publication policy is to encourage collaboration and coordination among investigators while ensuring the timely release of research to the scientific community. The document provides general guidelines and a description of the process for disclosure of planned publications within the consortium through submission. This policy will be drafted and updated by the HPRC Administration and Coordination Working Group and approved by the HPRC steering committee.</description>
